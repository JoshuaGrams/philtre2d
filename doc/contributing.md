File Names
----------

Engine systems like the scene tree, input manager, and so on use lower-case file names with hyphens.

Game objects (Body, Text, etc.) use CamelCase file names.

Modules from external sources or which are just useful to have but aren't used by the engine systems or game objects go in `lib/` and have lower-case file-names with hyphens.
