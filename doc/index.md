==========

Engine
------

* [Scene Graph](engine/scene-graph.md) - Handles object
  collections and transforms.

* [Draw Order](engine/draw-order.md) - Cooperates with the scene
  graph to draw objects by depth or by layer, for cases where
  drawing them in order of scene graph traversal isn't
  sufficient.

* [Matrix](engine/matrix.md) - Transformations (rotate, scale,
  skew, translate) represented as 3x3 matrices (2D homogeneous
  coordinates).
