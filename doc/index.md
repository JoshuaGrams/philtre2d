Philtre 2D
==========

Engine
------

* [Scene Tree](engine/scene-tree.md) - Handles object
  collections and transforms.

* [Draw Order](engine/draw-order.md) - Cooperates with the scene
  graph to draw objects by depth or by layer, for cases where
  drawing them in order of scene graph traversal isn't
  sufficient.

* [Matrix](engine/matrix.md) - Transformations (rotate, scale,
  skew, translate) represented as 3x3 matrices (2D homogeneous
  coordinates).

Objects
-------

* [Body](engine/body.md) - Physics body object.

* Sprite - Object containing an image.

* [Camera](https://github.com/rgrams/lovercam/blob/master/Readme.md) - Camera object (by Lovercam)

* GUI Sprite - Sprite with anchors and that scales when parent is resized.

* GUI Root - Root 'window' object for GUI. Needs to get `love.resize` calls.


Todo
----

* Automated tests.

* Start on editor.

* Scene-tree - prevent path overlaps!
* Scene-tree - set_parent()
* Input manager
* Asset loader - should only load each asset once
    * Just use Cargo? (it loads things only when they are used)
* Physics wrapper
    * one call to init world & set callbacks
* Pausing
    * flag to stop update (but not draw) from continuing down the tree
    * pause/resume function call down the tree to stop sounds?
        * One recursive call rather than pause/resume functions on every single object?
    * stop input?
* Sound object
    * pre-allocate multiple voices (sources)
* Text/'Label' object
* Joint object (physics)
* Add vec2 library?
* Add missing math functions?
* Sprite batching?
* GUI 9-Patch object
* GUI Stencils (for scroll boxes)
    * `love.graphics.setStencil()`
    * Need a callback after children have drawn to reset stencil
* Emitter object...
